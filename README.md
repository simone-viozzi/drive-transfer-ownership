# drive transfere ownership
Currently google drive don't have a function/api to change owner to files and transfere the quota from a user to another. So i creaded this google colab that use the drive package to transfere the ownership of folder and build-in file types (like google docs and spreadsheet) and dowload from an account and upload from another for all the other files (the one that actually take space in drive).

I did this in colab because it's bandwith is pretty high and does't consume local resources.
